The ampersand is a special character in shell commands that puts processes in the background, which is causing the path to be misinterpreted.
Here's how to fix it:

Either rename your directory from "map&tries" to "map_tries" or "mapAndTries" (remove the &)
OR if you want to keep the & in the directory name, you need to escape it in the path by either:

Using quotes around the path
Using a backslash before the &



Here's what you can do:

The safest solution - rename the directory:

bashCopy# Rename the directory
mv "14_map&tries" "14_map_tries"

Or update your launch.json configuration to use escaped paths. You can modify it to:

jsonCopy{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      // Your other configuration settings...
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/14_map_tries/map/implimentation_map"  // Use underscores instead
    }
  ]
}
The simpler solution is to avoid using special characters like & in directory and file names. I recommend using underscores (_) or camelCase naming conventions instead, as they're more widely supported and less likely to cause issues with command-line tools and build systems. CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Vi have replaced the& to _ but what was the reson to remove it (&) ??EditThe & character needed to be removed because it has a special meaning in command line interfaces and shell scripting. Here's why:

In Unix/Linux shells (like bash), & is used as a control operator that tells the shell to run a command in the background. For example:

bashCopycommand1 & command2   # This runs command1 in background and command2 immediately after

When you had "map&tries" in your path, the shell interpreted it like this:

It saw: /workspaces/cpp-dsa/14_map&tries/...
It understood this as: "run /workspaces/cpp-dsa/14_map in the background AND THEN run tries/..."
This obviously wasn't what you wanted - you meant & as part of the directory name


Other special characters that should generally be avoided in file/directory names:

Space ( )
Ampersand (&)
Hash (#)
Asterisk (*)
Exclamation mark (!)
Question mark (?)
Pipe (|)
Quotes (' and ")
Less than/greater than (< >)



This is why developers typically use:

Underscores (_)
Hyphens (-)
camelCase
PascalCase
